# Statistic

This repo represents things that ı learned from statistic. I will share the knowledges lecture to lecture.

You know statistic is a so big and involved topic and this lectures will be so long.. 

Okay then why do we wait? let's go the lecture.

## Lecture - 1: Figuring out the histogram

To understand the statistic clearly, you need to understand the histogram clearly.

İmagine you went out and measured someone's tall and then you put it into a line that is 160 cm to 190 cm.

                                    |----------|----------|----------|
                                    1.60 m     1.70       1.80       1.90

And then measured someone else and someone else. You will see some measurements are hidden exactly. But think, what will be other measurument? 

bamm! that is it! we can use the histogram to predict the future measurement or to approximate the data.
